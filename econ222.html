<h1>Bring a laptop!</h1>

<b><p>Experimental Economics is a field of economics where we collect data and test hypotheses about human behavior in a controlled setting.</p>

<p>The subjects in economics experiments are college students, i.e. YOU!</p>
<p>Subjects earn money for participating in the experiment and the amount earned depends on their behavior in the experiment:  better performance in the experiment leads to more money.</p>
<p>Everyone who participates and completes the experiment will earn a $10 show-up fee.</p>
<p>Everyone who participates will earn additional money.  The amount will depend on their performance in the experiment.</p>
<p>Likely earnings are between $20 and $40 (although could be more or less).</p>
<p>At the beginning of the experiment, we will explain exactly how you earn money during the experiment.</p>
<p>The experiment will take approximately 90 minutes.</p>
